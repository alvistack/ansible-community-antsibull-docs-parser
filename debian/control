Description: Python library for processing Ansible documentation markup
 This is a Python library for processing Ansible documentation markup. It
 is named after antsibull-docs where this code originates from. It was
 moved out to make it easier to reuse the markup code in other projects
 without having to depend on all of antsibull-docs's dependencies.
